Files:

1)main.java: 
Run this file to play the game. This class contains the main function and works as the main script, creating object for the magic_cube class and ttt class. The user is first asked if they want to play first and is then required to choose from the following options as the winning strategy:
	(a) one collinear line
	(b) two collinear lines
	(c) who so ever gets more lines than its opponent after the 20th move

2) ttt.java:
This class governs all the actions computer takes to interact with the user and chooses the next move while utilising magic_cube as the 3D cube on which the game is played.


3)magic_cube.java:
This class uses the concept of a magic cube to implement an algorithm to create a 3D Magic Cube of 11 surfaces. It also implements some collinearity conditions to generate the three essential lists based on sum and collinearity. 


4)Tuple.java:
The Tuple class is a way of storing a set of three integers as a tuple object, which is used in the magic_cube.
